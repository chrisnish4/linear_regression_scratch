### Line of Best Fit vs. Closed Form Derivative vs. Gradient Descent 

The purpose of this notebook is to better my understanding of linear regression as a whole. I will be comparing three different methods of linear regression: line of best fit equations, closed form derivatives, and iterative otpimization. I would like to see if these methods all produce the same output, and if not, why?

### Findings
- Line of best fit formulas can be derived from the closed form optimization techniques, so results were the same
- Gradient descent using sum of squared errors as the loss function converged to the same values as both prior methods
